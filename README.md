# Progress-Tracker-App
Repository for Progress Tracker App created for COM 430 Software Development
Created by: Ashli Collige, Anthony Skinner, Lisa Torro, and Thomas Williams

# App Description
The app is based off a KanBan board used to track the progress of projects in software development. A KanBan board has columns titled for progress stages and sticky notes that detail the work that needs to be done. Each sticky note should be moved to the column of the tasks status. For example, a sticky note that is in progress gets placed into the In Progress column. There may also be columns such as Stuck for when a task encounters issues that need assistance. 

# Features - v0.1
- A GUI that contains default columns. 
- A button to add a new task/sticky note.
